## Suggested IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

- VS Codium

> Visual Studio Code is a Microsoft product & licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/), but, Microsoft also licensed  Visual Studio Code under this [license](https://code.visualstudio.com/license) and contains telemetry/tracking. 

>Here's a quote from a maintainer for Visual Studio Code:
>> When we [Microsoft] build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.
>> When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a “clean” build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license

## Suggested emulator

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Apple, Linux, or Windows)

> While Android Studio is a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in this case we'll be using Android Studio for the AVD (Android Virtual Device) feature.

- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Apple Only)

> While XCode is a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in this case we'll be using XCode for the simulator feature.
